üõ†Ô∏è Description  
This project focuses on designing a scaffold for large bone defects, specifically targeting the humerus bone, using advanced computational methods. The goal was to create a FCCZ (Face-Centered Cubic Z) structure that can be used as a potential solution for bone defect treatment through 3D printing and biomaterial scaffolding.

üßÆ Project Workflow
- Fracture Replacement Design: The fractured portion of the humerus bone was initially modeled using SOLIDWORKS 2023. The model served as the base for defining the coordinates of the nodes and elements uaing ANSYS.
- Organizing Nodes for FCCZ Structure: Using MATLAB, the coordinates of the nodes were organized into a FCCZ structure. This structure was achieved through an optimization algorithm that arranges the nodes into a lattice configuration suitable for bone replacement.
- 3D Model Generation: The coordinates and elements of the FCCZ scaffold were then processed using a modified version of the code from the [3D-printed splints demo tutorial](https://github.com/sim3DMedLab/3D-printed-splints-demo-tutorial). This step converted the nodes and elements into a 3D mesh model using BLENDER.
- Finite Element Analysis: The final FCCZ scaffold design was subjected to a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) using ANSYS to assess its mechanical properties and suitability for bone replacement.
